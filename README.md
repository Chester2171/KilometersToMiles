# KilometersToMiles
 
This is a conversion application that we built as a class during the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA). It started as simply writing C# code to convert Kilometers to Miles and then Miles to Kilometers and progressed from there. This is what we were able to create in the span of about 1.5 - 2 hours give or take a little bit.
